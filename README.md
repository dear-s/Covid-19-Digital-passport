# Covid-19-Digital-passport

- Developed at Pearl Hacks 2021
- Currently, travelers have to get themselves tested, they travel and show the results at the time of travel. The inconvenience can be avoided for an individual by showing the digital covid passport.
- Learned React.js and developed a full stack web app within 24 hours.
- Used the MERN stack for developing this web app. Also, stored data in different schemas so that it's easily accessible to the users and the hospital vaccination providers.
